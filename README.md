**Abstract:**
Classical decision theory is in a strong conflict with the observed experimental data coming from cognitive and descriptive decision making research. This conflict yields different paradoxes and inconsistencies. It was shown that quantum-like approach to decision making solves these problems, but the reasons why it does so far stayed unknown. 

This thesis presents new framework that i) introduces more general formalisation of decision making task ii) step-by-step shows, that under realistic assumptions a solution is found without prior definition of probability iii) shows quantum nature of uncertainty and claims that quantum models are inevitable for decision making.

The author deeply acknowledges the contribution of his supervisors. The extended version of this work is under preparation.
